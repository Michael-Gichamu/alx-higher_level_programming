* Design

Database Development Life Cycle - Which involves Requirement Analysis, Database Design and Implementation.

* Normalization

Database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into smaller tables and links them using relationships. The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored logically.

* ER Modeling

Graphical approach to database design. It is a high-level data model that defines data elements and their relationship for a specified software system. An ER model is used to represent real-world objects.
