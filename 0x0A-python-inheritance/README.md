# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

This project involved learning how inheritance works and tackled various tasks implenting inheritance.
Inheritance provides a way to reuse code, promote code reusability, and organize classes into hierarchies that model real-world relationships between objects.

## Learning Objectives.

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

### Test Cases.

Test files are in the tests folder.
To execute the test cases use this command:
```
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
```
